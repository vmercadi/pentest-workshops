# First of all do a scan of the network to find the ip of th vm : 
## arp-scan 
`arp-scan -l -I eth0 `
* `-l --localnet` generate addresses from the local network
* `-I`    specify the network interface

`10.0.2.1/3` are used by virtualbox. 
`10.0.2.7` this one is instersting ! 

# Scan for the most commons names
## dirb
`dirb http://10.0.2.7`
* by defaut dirb scan the port 80.

 `http://10.0.2.7/passwords/` that must be good..


## Checking the passwords/ direcory 
-------------------------------------------
![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/passwords_dir.png)

Is that the frist flag ?? 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/passwords_flag.png)

Yes it is, nice ! Let's go on. 
We'll now check the other page : 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/passwords_0.png)

Humm.. nothing here but there was a password but Rick has hidden it.
and if we looking for hidden things..

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/passwords_1.png)

hidden things we found !!

* we've got a password `winter` let's keept that in mind.
-------------------------------------------------


## Checking the robot.txt file 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/robots.png)

`root_shell.cgi` looks nice but it's a fake, there is nothing.

maybe we'll get more luck with `tracertool.cgi`

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/trace.png)

if we submit a random value like `AAAAAAAAAAAA` it print nothing
but if we give a good parameter to the Morty's tracertool it returns `traceroute to localhost (127.0.0.1)`

* traceroute is a linux cmd. 

*That's mean somehow there is a command executed in the shell. 
* So maybe we can use the propriety of the shell to get more liberty with this tool. 
We can try to use the `;`

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/trace1.png)

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/traceid.png)

lets take a look at the `/etc/passwd` file 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/tracecat.png)

oops `cat` seems broken ^^ `tail` is a good alternative 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/tracetail.png)

We have now 3 username : `RickSanchez` `Morty` `Summer` 

------------------------------------------
## quick step back, why can we execute several commands with `;`

take a look at the source code of `tracertool.cgi`

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/tracecode.png)

* it first "reverse" the html encoding with several `sed` 
* then `eval` of `traceroute + $our_string`
from the man : 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/tracecode.png)

that mean eval just give the whole chain to bash and this one interpret it.

------------------------------------------
we can't do much more with the apache user. 

# More Scans ..
## nmap
`nmap -p- -T5 -A -sV 10.0.2.7`
* `-p-` scan from port 1 to port 65586
* `-T5` to scan faster  
* `-A` which turns on version detection and other Advanced and Aggressive features 
* `-sV` To enable version detection

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/nmap.png)

## Port 21 
ftp classic, we can see we have acces to the anonymous user and there is probably a flag here : 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/ftp.png)

## Port 22
nmap guess that is a ssh port because it's on port 22 but it's not.

## Port 9090
just check it on your browser : 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/9090.png)

nice one more ! 

## Port 60000
reverse shell from Rick.
let's try to connect with `nc`

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/revshell.png)

## Port 22222
ssh port, we need a username and a password. 
so far we discover 3 usernames `RickSnachez` `Morty` `Summer` and one password `winter` (:80/passwords/passwords.html)

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/ssh.png)

nice one more flag found and we are on the machine !
with some digging we find out that we have the right permissions to access to Morty's home. 
Morty has a zip file protected by a password. And an img who's probably hide the password.
the password seems to look like `Meeseek`

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/zip.png)

all right ! next step hack Rick's safe ! 
after some trys i realize that the flag we got right before is a little weird 

![alt-text](https://github.com/nidzik/Pentest_asn_1/blob/master/img/safe.png)

we got a hint for the last lvl 
just create a passwd list with this pattern : 
UP_LETTER + DIGIT + Curtains (the band group is The Flesh Curtain, and curtains seems right for the passwd )
a little and dirty python script  + `hydra`

Root -- Last Flag :D
